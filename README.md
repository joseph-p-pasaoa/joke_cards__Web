# joke_cards__Web

A web app I built that serves ten joke cards at a time with hidden punchlines until the cards are clicked. 
Fetches from the [Official Jokes API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) created by David Katz.

Features include:
  1. Fetch API utilization
  1. Jokes are prevented from appearing again until all jokes have been drawn once
  1. Css styling
